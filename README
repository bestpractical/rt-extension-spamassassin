NAME
    RT::Extension::SpamAssassin - Spam filter for RT

SYNOPSIS
        # in RT config
        Set(@Plugins, 'RT::Extension::SpamAssassin', ...other plugins...);
        Set(@MailPlugins, 'RT::Extension::SpamAssassin', ...other filters...);
        Set(%SpamAssassinOptions, debug => ..., userprefs_filename => ...);

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin checks to see if an incoming mail is spam (using
    "spamassassin") and if so, rewrites its headers. If the mail is very
    definitely spam - 1.5x more hits than required - then it is dropped on
    the floor; otherwise, it is passed on as normal.
